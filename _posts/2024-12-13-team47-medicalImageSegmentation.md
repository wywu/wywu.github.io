## Introduction

Our group explored medical image segmentation, an increasingly critical tool in
healthcare that has been used for decades to help doctors and researchers
analyze medical scans like MRIs, CT scans, and X-rays. In the past, segmentation
was done either manually — requiring painstaking effort from medical
professionals — or using basic computer algorithms that often lacked precision.
These traditional methods struggled with issues like the variability between
different patients' scans, the complexity of human anatomy, and the quality of
the images, which could be blurry or noisy.

However, the rise of deep learning in recent years has transformed the field of
medical image segmentation. Deep learning models can automatically analyze
thousands of images and learn to identify patterns, making the segmentation
process faster and more accurate. This has led to significant improvements in
the ability to detect tumors, delineate organs, and monitor diseases. Deep
learning can adapt to different types of medical images and handle the natural
variability found in human tissues more effectively than older methods.

While challenges like image noise and medical uncertainty still exist, deep
learning has pushed the boundaries of what medical image segmentation can
achieve. With continued research and better data, this technology holds great
promise for improving patient care and advancing medical knowledge.

### Definition

Medical image segmentation is a technique used to partition medical images, such
as MRI or CT scans, into regions of interest. These regions can include organs,
tissues, tumors, and other abnormalities. However, regardless of what region,
accurate segmentation is essential for a wide range of applications in clinical
practice and medical research.

Medical image segmentation differs from standard image classification because it
requires high precision and accuracy due to the nuanced nature of medical
diagnosis. Misclassifications can lead to incorrect treatment plans or flawed
research conclusions.

Given a 2D or 3D medical image, the objective is to generate a segmentation mask
with the same dimensions. Each pixel or voxel in the mask is assigned a label
corresponding to predefined categories, such as organs, lesions, or background.

### Applications

This kind of segmentation has a profound impact on both clinical and research
settings. In clinical practice, it enhances the precision of diagnostic
procedures, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. For instance, accurate
tumor segmentation can significantly improve the outcomes of radiotherapy by
targeting cancerous tissues while sparing healthy ones. In research,
segmentation facilitates the creation of high-quality datasets for training
machine learning models, advancing our understanding of various diseases, and
developing new therapeutic strategies.

- **Clinical Applications**:

  - **Tumor Detection**: Identifying the presence and extent of tumors.
  - **Treatment Planning**: Assisting in radiotherapy and surgical procedures.
  - **Disease Monitoring**: Tracking changes in pathology over time.

- **Research Applications**:
  - **Machine Learning**: Preparing datasets for training and evaluating AI
    models.
  - **Disease Analysis**: Understanding the progression of diseases such as
    cancer or neurodegenerative disorders. 
  - **Monitoring Disease Progression**:
    In oncology, segmentation helps track changes in tumor size or shape across
    multiple scans. For instance, sequential MRI scans can be segmented to
    visualize and quantify how a tumor responds to chemotherapy.

Other examples include:

- **Surgical Planning**: Segmenting organs and tissues to assist surgeons in
  planning minimally invasive procedures.
- **Radiotherapy**: Accurately delineating tumor boundaries to target radiation
  precisely while sparing healthy tissue.

## Deep Learning-Based Solutions

## U-Net

**U-Net** is a widely used convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture
designed for image segmentation tasks. It has become a cornerstone in medical
image segmentation due to its effectiveness, especially with limited datasets.

#### Key Features

- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances performance on small datasets.
- **Detailed Masks**: Produces segmentation masks with high accuracy.
- **Flexibility**: Applicable to both 2D and 3D image segmentation tasks.
- **Simplicity and Robustness**: Easy to implement and train.

#### Architecture

U-Net follows an **encoder-decoder** structure that captures both spatial
context and fine-grained details:

1. **Encoder (Contracting Path)**:

   - The encoder uses convolutional and pooling layers to systematically extract
     features from the input image while progressively reducing the spatial
     dimensions. This process allows the network to capture essential details at
     different levels of abstraction. As the spatial dimensions decrease, the
     feature depth increases, enabling the model to learn and represent more
     complex, hierarchical information about the image.

1. **Decoder (Expanding Path)**:

   - The decoder restores the spatial dimensions of the feature maps by using
     upsampling, specifically through transposed convolutions. During this
     process, the decoder integrates features from the encoder using skip
     connections, which help retain important details lost during the
     downsampling phase. This combination of upsampling and skip connections
     refines the segmentation mask, ensuring that fine-grained details and
     spatial context are preserved.

#### Visualization

The U-Net architecture can be visualized as a U-shaped design that combines
feature extraction in the encoder path with upsampling in the decoder path.
Below is a diagram illustrating the architecture:

![Diagram of U-Net architecture.](/CS163-Projects-2024Fall/assets/images/team47/u-net-architecture.png)

**Fig. 1.** Illustration of the U-Net architecture with its characteristic
encoder-decoder structure. The encoder extracts features through convolution and
pooling, while the decoder restores spatial dimensions using up-convolutions and
skip connections to produce the segmentation map. Dimensions of feature maps and
key operations are annotated for clarity. Adapted from Ronneberger et al., 2015
[1]

#### Training Process

1. **Data Preparation**: Labeled images are preprocessed through resizing,
   normalization, and augmentation.
2. **Forward Pass**: The input image is passed through the network to produce a
   segmentation map.
3. **Loss Calculation**: The predicted segmentation map is compared with the
   ground truth using a loss function such as Dice Loss.
4. **Backward Pass**: The model's parameters are updated using gradient descent
   and an optimizer like Adam.
5. **Training Loop**: The process is repeated over multiple epochs to minimize
   loss.
6. **Validation and Testing**: The model's accuracy is evaluated on unseen data.

### Limitations of U-Net

- **Conceptual Gap**: Encoder captures low-level details, while the decoder
  captures high-level semantics, making integration challenging.
- **Skip Connection Issues**: Direct skip connections may lead to poor feature
  fusion, affecting segmentation accuracy.

### Implementation

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class UNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels=1, out_channels=1):
        super(UNet, self).__init__()

        # Encoder layers
        self.enc1 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(in_channels, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU()
        )
        self.pool1 = nn.MaxPool2d(2)

        self.enc2 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(128, 128, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU()
        )
        self.pool2 = nn.MaxPool2d(2)

        # Decoder layers
        self.up2 = nn.ConvTranspose2d(128, 64, kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.dec2 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(128, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU()
        )

        self.final = nn.Conv2d(64, out_channels, kernel_size=1)

    def forward(self, x):
        # Encoder
        e1 = self.enc1(x)
        p1 = self.pool1(e1)

        e2 = self.enc2(p1)
        p2 = self.pool2(e2)

        # Decoder
        up2 = self.up2(e2)
        merge2 = torch.cat([up2, e1], dim=1)
        d2 = self.dec2(merge2)

        out = self.final(d2)
        return out
```

This implementation of U-Net creates the essential encoder-decoder structure of
U-Net with skip connections. It can be expanded with various optimization
techniques, such as adding more layers, data augmentation, and further.

### Literature on U-Net

The architecture of U-Net was designed to address the challenges of medical
image segmentation, where annotated data is often scarce. Ronneberger and
colleagues demonstrated that U-Net could achieve state-of-the-art results by
using extensive data augmentation techniques, such as elastic deformations, to
compensate for the lack of training samples. Their network successfully
outperformed the prior best methods in the ISBI 2012 challenge for neuronal
structure segmentation in electron microscopy images and won the ISBI 2015 cell
tracking challenge for light microscopy datasets [1].

Key innovations highlighted in their work include:

Symmetrical Encoder-Decoder Structure: U-Net's encoder-decoder design allows it
to capture contextual information while retaining high-resolution details
through skip connections. This combination ensures precise localization of
segmented regions, making it highly suitable for biomedical tasks.

Data Efficiency: The network was shown to be trainable end-to-end with only a
few annotated images, leveraging data augmentation to improve robustness to
variations like deformations and gray-scale changes [1].

Fast Inference: U-Net's efficient architecture enables the segmentation of a
512x512 image in less than a second on a modern GPU, making it practical for
real-world clinical applications [1].

The original implementation, based on Caffe, and the trained networks were made
publicly available, accelerating further research and adoption in the medical
imaging community.

While we only briefly extrapolated these concepts, it provided a basis of
understanding and we highly recommend their paper for those who would like more
details.

## U-Net++

**U-Net++** improves upon U-Net by introducing **dense, nested skip
connections**, refining the encoder's features before they are passed to the
decoder. Its enhanced structure leads to improved segmentation performance,
particularly in complex medical scenarios [2].

- **Feature Refinement**: Intermediate convolutional layers progressively refine
  encoder features before passing them to the decoder.
- **Modular Design**: Easily integrates with other deep learning techniques for
  enhanced performance.

#### Visualization

The architecture of U-Net++ is illustrated in the following figure:

![Diagram of U-Net architecture.](/CS163-Projects-2024Fall/assets/images/team47/u-net++-architecture.png)

**Fig. 2.** Illustration of the U-Net++ architecture with its encoder-decoder
structure connected through nested dense convolutional blocks. These redesigned
skip pathways reduce the semantic gap between the feature maps of the encoder
and decoder, allowing for more effective feature fusion. Adapted from Zhou et
al., 2020 [2].

### Multi-Dimensional U-CNN

The **Multi-Dimensional U-Convolutional Neural Network** further refines U-Net++
by:

- **Horizontal Refinement**: Adding convolution layers between encoder and
  decoder features to improve feature alignment.
- **Vertical Alignment**: Feeding feature maps from each layer into the
  horizontal convolution path for enhanced feature extraction.

#### Visualization

The architecture of MDU-CNN is illustrated below:

![Diagram of U-Net architecture.](/CS163-Projects-2024Fall/assets/images/team47/mdu-cnn-architecture.png)

**Fig. 3.** The architecture of MDU-CNN integrates multi-dimensional blocks with
horizontal and vertical refinement mechanisms. This design enhances feature
alignment and extraction, resulting in improved segmentation accuracy. Adapted
from Srinivasan et al., 2024 [3].

#### Performance Evaluation

When tested on 5 distinct datasets, each with its own unique challenges, MDU-CNN
had a better performance of 1.32%, 5.19%, 4.50%, 10.23%, and 0.87%
respectively-- a notable improvement upon traditional U-Net architecture [4].

### Implementation

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class UNetPlusPlus(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels=1, out_channels=1, num_filters=64):
        super(UNetPlusPlus, self).__init__()

        # Initial convolutional layers
        self.conv1 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(in_channels, num_filters, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(num_filters, num_filters, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU()
        )
        self.pool1 = nn.MaxPool2d(2)

        self.conv2 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(num_filters, num_filters * 2, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(num_filters * 2, num_filters * 2, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU()
        )
        self.pool2 = nn.MaxPool2d(2)

        # Decoder layers
        self.up2 = nn.ConvTranspose2d(num_filters * 2, num_filters, kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.conv2_1 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(num_filters * 2, num_filters, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(num_filters, num_filters, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU()
        )

        self.final = nn.Conv2d(num_filters, out_channels, kernel_size=1)

    def forward(self, x):
        # Encoder
        e1 = self.conv1(x)
        p1 = self.pool1(e1)

        e2 = self.conv2(p1)

        # Decoder with nested skip connection
        up2 = self.up2(e2)
        merge2 = torch.cat([up2, e1], dim=1)
        d2 = self.conv2_1(merge2)

        out = self.final(d2)
        return out
```

This basic implementation captures the nested skip connections of U-Net++, which
refine features more effectively than the standard U-Net. The model can also be
further expanded by adding more layers or blocks to match the full complexity of
U-Net++. [2]

### Literature on U-Net++

Zhou et al. identified two primary challenges with U-Net: the difficulty in
determining optimal network depth and the restrictive nature of same-scale skip
connections. To overcome these, U-Net++ introduces the following key
innovations:

Redesigned Skip Connections: Instead of direct skip connections between encoder
and decoder layers, U-Net++ employs dense, nested skip connections. These
connections aggregate features from varying scales, allowing more flexible and
effective feature fusion. This design helps in retaining both high-level
semantic information and low-level spatial details, resulting in more accurate
segmentation maps [2].

Ensemble of U-Nets: U-Net++ embeds multiple U-Nets of varying depths within a
single architecture. These U-Nets share a common encoder but have separate
decoders, facilitating collaborative learning through deep supervision. This
approach mitigates the uncertainty around choosing the optimal depth for the
network and improves segmentation quality for objects of different sizes [2].

Pruning for Efficiency: To address computational efficiency, U-Net++ supports a
pruning scheme that accelerates inference by removing redundant layers while
maintaining performance. This feature makes U-Net++ adaptable to
resource-constrained environments without sacrificing segmentation accuracy [2].

Extensive evaluations by Zhou et al. on six medical imaging datasets, including
CT, MRI, and electron microscopy, demonstrated that U-Net++ consistently
outperforms the original U-Net and other baseline models. The architecture is
particularly effective in segmenting fine structures and objects with
significant size variations, making it a robust tool for medical image
segmentation [2].

## nnU-Net

**nnU-Net** ("no-new-U-Net") automates the process of adapting U-Net to new
datasets, providing a robust and standardized pipeline [5]. By examining
properties of the input dataset and adjusting hyperparameters and architectural
details accordingly, nnU-Net streamlines preprocessing, architecture selection,
training, and post-processing steps. Compared to earlier architectures, it
removes much of the trial-and-error involved in configuring segmentation models,
allowing for state-of-the-art results across diverse medical imaging tasks
without manual tuning.

### Configurations

1. **Fixed Configurations**:

   - Learning rate, loss function, and optimizer remain consistent across
     datasets.

2. **Rule-Based Configurations**:

   - Adjustments for patch size, normalization, and batch size based on dataset
     properties.

3. **Empirical Configurations**:
   - Fine-tuning and post-processing based on validation performance.

### Pipeline

1. **Data Fingerprinting**: Extract image properties like spacing, intensity,
   and shape.
2. **Configuration Decisions**: Apply rule-based adjustments to network
   topology.
3. **Empirical Optimization**: Post-processing and ensembling to improve
   performance.
4. **Validation**: Ensures model robustness and generalization.

### Implementation

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class nnUNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels=1, out_channels=1, num_filters=64):
        super(nnUNet, self).__init__()

        # Encoder blocks
        self.enc1 = self.conv_block(in_channels, num_filters)
        self.enc2 = self.conv_block(num_filters, num_filters * 2)
        self.enc3 = self.conv_block(num_filters * 2, num_filters * 4)

        # Pooling layers
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2)

        # Decoder blocks
        self.up3 = nn.ConvTranspose2d(num_filters * 4, num_filters * 2, kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.dec3 = self.conv_block(num_filters * 4, num_filters * 2)

        self.up2 = nn.ConvTranspose2d(num_filters * 2, num_filters, kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.dec2 = self.conv_block(num_filters * 2, num_filters)

        # Final output layer
        self.final = nn.Conv2d(num_filters, out_channels, kernel_size=1)

    def conv_block(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        return nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(out_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU()
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        # Encoder
        e1 = self.enc1(x)
        p1 = self.pool(e1)

        e2 = self.enc2(p1)
        p2 = self.pool(e2)

        e3 = self.enc3(p2)

        # Decoder
        up3 = self.up3(e3)
        d3 = self.dec3(torch.cat([up3, e2], dim=1))

        up2 = self.up2(d3)
        d2 = self.dec2(torch.cat([up2, e1], dim=1))

        # Final output
        out = self.final(d2)
        return out

```

### Literature on nnU-Net

nnU-Net was introduced by Isensee et al., 2018 as a self-adapting framework
designed to overcome the limitations of manually configuring U-Net architectures
for different medical imaging tasks [5]. The key innovation of nnU-Net lies in
its ability to automatically adapt network architecture, preprocessing, and
training pipelines based on the characteristics of the input dataset. This
automation allows nnU-Net to deliver state-of-the-art performance across a wide
range of segmentation tasks without requiring manual adjustments or
hyperparameter tuning.

Key Contributions Automated Configuration: nnU-Net evaluates the dataset's image
geometry and automatically selects the optimal U-Net variant (2D U-Net, 3D
U-Net, or cascaded U-Net) along with appropriate patch sizes, pooling
operations, and batch sizes [5]. This eliminates the need for trial-and-error
adjustments, making the framework highly versatile and efficient.

Preprocessing and Training Pipeline: The framework defines a comprehensive
pipeline that includes cropping, resampling to a median voxel spacing, intensity
normalization (For CT images: clip to [0.5, 99.5] percentile range and z-score
normalization; For MRI: z-score normalization after nonzero mean computation),
and extensive data augmentation techniques like elastic deformations and gamma
correction. These steps are dynamically adapted for each dataset to maximize
segmentation performance [5].

Empirical Evaluation: nnU-Net was evaluated in the Medical Segmentation
Decathlon, a challenge comprising ten distinct medical imaging tasks. It
achieved top rankings across multiple datasets, demonstrating its robustness and
generalizability. Notably, nnU-Net outperformed manually optimized architectures
by focusing on effective preprocessing, training, and inference strategies
rather than introducing novel architectural changes [5].

Ensembling and Post-Processing: To enhance robustness, nnU-Net employs model
ensembling and test-time augmentations. Post-processing techniques, such as
enforcing single connected components, further refine the segmentation results
[5].

This self-configuring approach positions nnU-Net as a powerful benchmark for
medical image segmentation, capable of adapting to new challenges with minimal
human intervention.

### Implementation nnUNetV2 with Bounding Box Prediction for 2D Data

   - Initial LR: 0.01 with poly learning rate policy
   - Batch size determined by: max*batch_size = floor(available_gpu_memory /
     (patch_size * channels \_ features_per_voxel))

### Evaluation Metrics

Medical image segmentation models are typically evaluated using several key
metrics that assess different aspects of segmentation accuracy. The Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) measures the overlap between predicted and ground
truth segmentations. The Intersection over Union (IoU), or Jaccard Index,
provides another measure of overlap that is particularly useful for irregular
shapes.

### Challenges and Limitations

Despite significant advances, medical image segmentation still faces several key
challenges. Data scarcity remains a primary constraint, as acquiring large
datasets of professionally annotated medical images is both time-consuming and
expensive. Class imbalance is another significant challenge, particularly in
pathology detection where the region of interest may comprise only a small
portion of the image. Image quality variations, including artifacts, noise, and
differences in acquisition protocols across medical facilities, can impact
segmentation accuracy. Moreover, the interpretability of deep learning models
remains a concern in medical applications where understanding the reasoning
behind segmentation decisions is crucial for clinical trust and adoption. There
are also computational challenges, as 3D medical images require significant
processing power and memory, potentially limiting real-time applications in
resource-constrained settings.

## Conclusion

Deep learning-based medical image segmentation models like **U-Net**,
**U-Net++**, and **nnU-Net** provide robust and efficient tools for clinical and
research applications. They have emerged from a rich body of literature, each
contributing key innovations: from U-Net's foundational encoder-decoder design,
to U-Net++'s refined nested skip connections, to nnU-Net's automated,
dataset-agnostic approach.Despite challenges related to dataset variability and
computational resources, these models represent significant advancements in
medical imaging. Looking ahead, several promising directions are emerging in
medical image segmentation. Transformer-based architectures are being integrated
with CNN-based models, combining the spatial awareness of CNNs with
transformers' ability to capture long-range dependencies. Federated learning
approaches are addressing data privacy concerns by enabling model training
across multiple institutions without sharing sensitive medical data.
Additionally, self-supervised learning techniques are helping to overcome the
limitation of scarce labeled medical data by leveraging large amounts of
unlabeled images for pre-training. These developments, coupled with advances in
hardware acceleration and edge computing, suggest a future where highly
accurate, real-time medical image segmentation becomes increasingly accessible
in clinical settings.Continued research and innovation will further improve
segmentation accuracy and accessibility.
