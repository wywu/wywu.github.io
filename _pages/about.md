I am a Research Associate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, working with [Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/).
<!-- I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in [VAIL @ UCLA](https://vail-ucla.github.io/) and [SVL @ Stanford](https://svl.stanford.edu/) (visiting), where I work with [Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/) and [Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/). -->
Previously, I served as a Research Scientist at Shanghai AI Lab, where I led the Virtual Human Group, working with [Dahua Lin](http://dahua.site/).
I was also a Visiting PhD at Nanyang Technological University, working with [Chen Change Loy](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/).
In June 2022, I obtained my PhD in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University.

  <h2>Research</h2>

  <p>My research lies at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and robotics. I aim to develop <strong style="color: rgb(255, 60, 0);">human-centric physical AI systems</strong> capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting with real-world environments populated by humans. To advance this vision, I address key challenges in the <em>scalability</em> of robot learning environments, the <em>situational awareness</em> of agents, and the <em>realism</em> of populated virtual humans. My work explores three primary directions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scalable World Simulators</strong>: Developing <u>large-scale robot learning platforms</u> with diverse assets and infinite urban scenes, and enabling high-efficiency robot training, as in <a href="https://metadriverse.github.io/metaurban/">MetaUrban</a>, <a href="publication/">URBAN-SIM</a>, <a href="https://metadriverse.github.io/vid2sim/">Vid2Sim</a>, and <a href="https://omniobject3d.github.io/">OmniObject3D</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Situational Behavior Modeling</strong>: Building <u>autonomous decision-making models</u> of humans and other agents, to behave robustly based on multimodal understanding of surroundings -- including vision, audio, and language, as in <a href="https://embodiedhuman.github.io/">EmbodiedHuman</a>, <a href="https://genforce.github.io/PedGen/">PedGen</a>, and <a href="https://metadriverse.github.io/s2e/">Seeing-to-Experiencing</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Realistic Virtual Humans</strong>: Constructing <u>high-fidelity 4D volumetric capture systems and datasets</u>, as in <a href="https://dna-rendering.github.io/">DNA-Rendering</a> and <a href="https://renderme-360.github.io/">RenderMe-360</a>; and developing <u>human foundation models</u> to obtain generalizable representations, as in <a href="https://cosmicman-cvpr2024.github.io/">CosmicMan</a> and <a href="https://motionbert.github.io/">MotionBert</a>.</li>
  </ul>
