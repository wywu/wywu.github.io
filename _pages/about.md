<!-- **About** -->

<!-- <p>Hey, thanks for stopping by! &#128516;</p> -->

I am an incoming Research Scientist at University of California, Los Angeles, working with [Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/). Since 2019, I have been a Cooperative Researcher at MMLab at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, working with [Chen Change Loy](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/). Previously, it was pleasant to work with [Dahua Lin](http://dahua.site/) and [Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/) closely.

<!-- , where I led the research and development of XR-Lab and SmartVideo Group. -->
In June 2022, I obtained my PhD in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University.

**The central goal of my research is to make Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems more and more usable.** An AI system includes two critical functions: 1) perceiving the real world that AI interacts with and 2) expressing the personal characteristic/action and situated environment of AI itself. To ultimately achieve the <em>usability</em> of AI systems, my research focuses on the following two key directions: 1) learning to perceive the real world to make the perceiving more effective with less supervision and 2) learning to generate/re-create the digital world to make the expressing easier with less human intervention. Further, my research also involves the construction of datasets and open-source software to facilitate the development of academia, centered around these two research directions. Moving forward, I am recently passionate about <em>human-like AI systems</em>., which will have better common sense in their perceiving system, as well as better creativity in their expressing system.
