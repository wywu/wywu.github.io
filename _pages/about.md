Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

<!-- **About** -->

<!-- <p>Hey, thanks for stopping by! &#128516;</p> -->

I am a Research Scientist at University of California, Los Angeles, working with [Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/). Since 2017, I have been a cooperative researcher at MMLab, working closely with [Dahua Lin](http://dahua.site/) and [Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/). In June 2022, I obtained my PhD in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. From 2019 to 2020, I was pleasure to work with [Chen Change Loy](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/) at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. My research lies at the intersection of computer vision and computer graphics, especially in the digital human generation and simulation.
