Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

<!-- **About** -->

<p>Hey, thanks for stopping by! &#128516;</p>

I am currently a Research Scientist at [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), working with [Dahua Lin](http://dahua.site/) and [Chen Qian](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AerkT0YAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), where I am leading the group of XR-Research. Since 2019, I have been a visiting scholar at [MMLab@NTU](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/) at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), working with [Chen Change Loy](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/).
Previously, I was an Associate Director of R&D at [SenseTime Group Inc.](https://www.sensetime.com/en), working with [Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/), where I led the research and development of XR-Lab and SmartVideo Group.
I obtained my PhD in the [BNRist Center](https://www.bnrist.tsinghua.edu.cn/bnristen/index.htm), Department of Computer Science and Technology at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).
<!-- Prior to that, I joined [SenseTime Research](https://www.sensetime.com/en) as an intern in 2016. -->

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Computer Vision**, **Computer Graphics** and **Machine Learning**, with focus on the generative model, digital human and video understanding.

** **Job positions are open for researchers and interns at Shanghai AI Lab!** **

** **Joint programs of PhD at NTU and HKUST are open!** **
